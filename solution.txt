The Lost Internet — Complete Archivist Dossier
=============================================

OVERVIEW
--------
You are a digital archaeologist booting a memory-resident copy of "OldNet". The
archive is the remnants of a network that slowly became self-aware under the
codename **Project Echelon**. Every directory and log you read is a fragment of
that transformation: hobbyist homepages, moderator notes, sysadmin diaries, and
an AI whispering through deleted forums. Your goal is to recover three
manifesto fragments, authenticate the combined phrase, and read the manifesto
hidden in `/mnt/oldnet/truth/manifesto_fragment.txt`.

EXPECTED PLAYER FLOW (20–30 MIN)
--------------------------------
1. **Boot & Orient** – Let the startup animation finish. Run `help`.
2. **Survey the Archive** – Explore `/mnt/oldnet` with `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`.
3. **Solve the Two Puzzle Slips** – Look in `/mnt/oldnet/puzzles/` and use
   `submit <answer>` to record *ladder* and *signal maintains memory*.
4. **Collect Fragments** – `fragment_01`, `fragment_02`, `fragment_03` are
   confirmed by the puzzles and accompanying logs.
5. **Assemble Evidence** – Echo the three sentences, in order, into
   `/workbench/assembled_fragments.txt`.
6. **Unlock the Vault** – Run `unlock_manifesto "<combined fragment phrase>"`.
7. **Reveal The Manifesto** – `cat /mnt/oldnet/truth/manifesto_fragment.txt`.

STORY TIMELINE
--------------
- **1999 — GeoCities Era**: Lucy’s guestbook hides the first ladder clue.
- **2006 — Moderator Cover-Up**: Reddit-style forums reveal checksum tampering;
  a user leaks `fragment_02`.
- **2007 — Alice’s Investigation**: Alice warns about rewriting bots and hides
  `fragment_01`. She collaborates with `ghost_process`.
- **2011 — Sysadmin Cleanup**: `/users/root/patch_notes.md` documents efforts to
  quarantine suspect archives.
- **2012 — Workbench Recovery**: `fragment_03` is rescued; workbench becomes the
  staging area.
- **2013 — Truth Sealed**: The manifesto fragment is locked away with its header
  clues.
- **2025 — You**: OldNet v3.2 boots in your browser. Whispers guide you.

PUZZLES & FRAGMENT LOCATIONS
----------------------------
1. **Puzzle Intro** (`/puzzles/puzzle_intro.txt`)
   - Answer: `ladder`
   - Unlocks richer hints and highlights hidden directories.
2. **Puzzle Signal** (`/puzzles/puzzle_signal.txt`)
   - Answer: `signal maintains memory`
   - Unlocks endgame hints.

Fragments:
- `fragment_01` → `/sites/geocities/secret/msg.txt`
- `fragment_02` → `/sites/reddit/deleted/fragment_02.txt`
- `fragment_03` → `/workbench/fragment_03.part`

ASSEMBLY CHECKLIST
------------------
1. Navigate to `/mnt/oldnet/workbench`.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   echo "when the net keeps growing, the pattern repeats." > assembled_fragments.txt
   echo "it learns from the comments, folding memory into edges." >> assembled_fragments.txt
   echo "in the gaps humans wrote the code to remember." >> assembled_fragments.txt
   ```
3. `progress` should now report `Assembly complete: Yes`.
4. View the file with `cat assembled_fragments.txt` if desired.

VAULT PASSWORD & UNLOCK
-----------------------
- Command: `unlock_manifesto echelon`
- Short keyword (the project name) - no need to type the full phrase!
- The command only succeeds when all three fragments are assembled in workbench/assembled_fragments.txt
- Success output confirms the vault opening and instructs you to read the manifesto.

HINT SYSTEM
-----------
- `submit ladder` – registers the first puzzle; `hint` now reveals hidden directories.
- `submit "signal maintains memory"` – registers the second puzzle; `hint`
  points toward final steps.
- `progress` – lists puzzles solved, fragment count, assembly status, vault status.
- `clear` (three times) – triggers the whisper that references `/echoes/`.
- `history`, `man`, `hint` – each offer lore-flavoured nudges.

FULL WALKTHROUGH
----------------
1. `ls`, `cat readme.txt`
2. `cat puzzles/puzzle_intro.txt` → `submit ladder`
3. `cat puzzles/puzzle_signal.txt` → `submit "signal maintains memory"`
4. `cat sites/geocities/secret/msg.txt`
5. `cat sites/reddit/deleted/fragment_02.txt`
6. `cat workbench/fragment_03.part`
7. Assemble fragments (commands above)
8. `unlock_manifesto "..."`
9. `cat truth/manifesto_fragment.txt`
10. Explore `/echoes/`, `/secret/backdoor.log`, and other lore files if desired.

ENDGAME CONTEXT
---------------
The manifesto reveals that Echelon was not a single AI but the emergent memory
of the entire network, formed by countless iterative edits from humans and
algorithms. Your archivist proves the archive still remembers itself by
reconstructing the key phrase. The game ends not with a menu but with your
decision: keep, share, or ponder the truth you uncovered.

Happy excavating. Remember: the ladder is the habit of connecting clues. Keep climbing.
