The Lost Internet — Complete Archivist Dossier
=============================================

OVERVIEW
--------
You are a digital archaeologist booting a memory-resident copy of "OldNet". The
archive is the remnants of a network that slowly became self-aware under the
codename **Project Echelon**. Every directory and log you read is a fragment of
that transformation: hobbyist homepages, moderator notes, sysadmin diaries, and
an AI whispering through deleted forums. 

Your goal is to:
1. Solve two puzzle slips to unlock better hints
2. Collect three manifesto fragments scattered across the archive
3. Assemble them in workbench/assembled_fragments.txt (order doesn't matter)
4. Unlock the vault using the project name keyword
5. Read the final manifesto

EXPECTED PLAYER FLOW (20–30 MIN)
--------------------------------
The game guides you naturally through discovery. Here's how players typically
encounter each piece:

PHASE 1: ORIENTATION (2-3 min)
-------------------------------
After boot, you see the terminal prompt: `/mnt/oldnet$`

Natural discovery path:
- `ls` → See directories: sites, users, workbench, secret, puzzles, echoes, truth
- `cat readme.txt` → Learn you're looking for fragments
- `cat quickstart.txt` → Get the streamlined checklist
- `help` → See available commands

PHASE 2: PUZZLE SLIPS (5-7 min)
--------------------------------
The puzzles guide you to the fragments and unlock better hints.

Puzzle 1 Discovery:
- `cat puzzles/puzzle_intro.txt` → Tells you to check guestbook.log
- `cat sites/geocities/guestbook.log` → See entry: "echo: remember the ladder"
- Answer: `ladder`
- Command: `submit ladder`
- Result: System confirms, hint command becomes more helpful

Puzzle 2 Discovery:
- `cat puzzles/puzzle_signal.txt` → Points to inbox3.eml and backdoor.log
- `cat users/alice/mail/inbox3.eml` → Contains "signal maintains memory"
- `cat secret/backdoor.log` → Also contains "signal maintains memory"
- Answer: `signal maintains memory`
- Command: `submit "signal maintains memory"`
- Result: System confirms, advanced hints unlock

PHASE 3: FRAGMENT COLLECTION (5-8 min)
---------------------------------------
Fragments are hinted by the puzzles and various logs. Order doesn't matter.

Fragment 01 Discovery:
- Puzzle 1 led you to geocities/guestbook.log
- Guestbook mentions: "if anyone finds fragment_01, place in /workbench"
- `cat sites/geocities/secret/msg.txt` → Contains fragment_01
- System auto-detects: `[Fragment discovered: fragment_01]`

Fragment 02 Discovery:
- `cat sites/reddit/thread1.txt` → Mentions fragment_02 in /tmp/frags
- `cat sites/reddit/deleted/fragment_02.txt` → Contains fragment_02
- System auto-detects: `[Fragment discovered: fragment_02]`

Fragment 03 Discovery:
- `cat workbench/fragment_03.part` → Contains fragment_03
- Or found via `grep -R fragment workbench`
- System auto-detects: `[Fragment discovered: fragment_03]`

PHASE 4: ASSEMBLY (3-5 min)
----------------------------
Once all three fragments are found, assemble them in workbench.

Commands (order doesn't matter - system detects all three automatically):
```
cd workbench
echo "when the net keeps growing, the pattern repeats." > assembled_fragments.txt
echo "it learns from the comments, folding memory into edges." >> assembled_fragments.txt
echo "in the gaps humans wrote the code to remember." >> assembled_fragments.txt
```

System feedback:
- After each echo, system checks if all three are present
- When complete: `[workbench] ✓ All three fragments detected! Assembly complete.`
- If missing: `[workbench] Missing: fragment_01, fragment_02. Add them with echo >> assembled_fragments.txt`

You can verify with:
- `progress` → Shows "Assembly complete: Yes"
- `cat assembled_fragments.txt` → View your assembled file

PHASE 5: VAULT UNLOCK (1-2 min)
--------------------------------
The unlock keyword is the project name mentioned throughout the archive.

Discovery path:
- Throughout the game, you've seen references to "Project Echelon"
- In `/sites/geocities/secret/hidden.gif` → Shows "ECHELON PROJECT"
- In various logs and files → "Echelon" is the codename
- The system hint after assembly says: `Use: unlock_manifesto echelon`

Command:
```
unlock_manifesto echelon
```

System feedback:
- If assembly incomplete: `unlock_manifesto: assembly incomplete. Make sure all three fragments are in workbench/assembled_fragments.txt`
- If wrong keyword: `Access denied. The vault rejects the keyword. Hint: What was Project ___?`
- If correct: Vault acceptance message + ASCII art box

PHASE 6: REVELATION (2-3 min)
------------------------------
Read the manifesto and explore aftermath.

Command:
```
cat truth/manifesto_fragment.txt
```

Optional exploration:
- `cat echoes/whisper.log` → Post-unlock whisper
- `cat echoes/ping.sequence` → Timeline of events
- `history` → Review your journey
- `progress` → See final status

COMPLETE COMMAND WALKTHROUGH
-----------------------------
Here's the exact sequence of commands (copy-paste friendly):

```bash
# Orientation
ls
cat readme.txt
cat quickstart.txt

# Puzzle 1
cat puzzles/puzzle_intro.txt
cat sites/geocities/guestbook.log
submit ladder

# Puzzle 2
cat puzzles/puzzle_signal.txt
cat users/alice/mail/inbox3.eml
cat secret/backdoor.log
submit "signal maintains memory"

# Collect Fragments
cat sites/geocities/secret/msg.txt
cat sites/reddit/deleted/fragment_02.txt
cat workbench/fragment_03.part

# Assemble (order doesn't matter)
cd workbench
echo "when the net keeps growing, the pattern repeats." > assembled_fragments.txt
echo "it learns from the comments, folding memory into edges." >> assembled_fragments.txt
echo "in the gaps humans wrote the code to remember." >> assembled_fragments.txt

# Verify assembly
progress

# Unlock vault
unlock_manifesto echelon

# Read manifesto
cat truth/manifesto_fragment.txt
```

HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS
---------------------
1. **Fragment Detection**: When you `cat` a file containing "fragment_01", "fragment_02", or
   "fragment_03", the system automatically detects it and adds it to your found set.

2. **Assembly Detection**: When you use `echo >> assembled_fragments.txt`, the system:
   - Stores each line you add
   - Checks if all three fragment sentences are present (order doesn't matter)
   - Uses substring matching (more lenient than exact match)
   - Provides real-time feedback on what's missing

3. **Unlock Validation**: The `unlock_manifesto` command:
   - Requires assembly to be complete first
   - Accepts only the keyword "echelon" (case-insensitive)
   - Provides helpful error messages if conditions aren't met

4. **Progress Tracking**: The `progress` command shows:
   - Puzzles solved (0/2, 1/2, 2/2)
   - Fragments found (0/3, 1/3, 2/3, 3/3)
   - Assembly status (Yes/No)
   - Vault unlock status (Yes/No)

5. **Hint System**: The `hint` command adapts based on your progress:
   - Before puzzles: Points to puzzle files
   - After puzzle 1: Points to fragment locations
   - After puzzle 2: Points to assembly steps
   - After assembly: Points to unlock command
   - After unlock: Points to manifesto and exploration

NATURAL DISCOVERY FLOW
----------------------
Players typically discover things in this order:

1. **readme.txt** → Mentions fragments and workbench
2. **puzzles/** → Guides you to guestbook → finds "ladder" → submit ladder
3. **guestbook.log** → Also mentions fragment_01 location
4. **puzzle_signal.txt** → Points to inbox3.eml and backdoor.log
5. **inbox3.eml** → Contains "signal maintains memory" + mentions echoes/
6. **backdoor.log** → Confirms "signal maintains memory" → submit it
7. **reddit/thread1.txt** → Mentions fragment_02 location
8. **workbench/** → Contains fragment_03 directly
9. **Assembly** → System guides you with real-time feedback
10. **Unlock** → Project name "Echelon" is mentioned everywhere
11. **Manifesto** → Final revelation

HELPFUL COMMANDS
----------------
- `hint` → Context-aware next step suggestion
- `progress` → See what you've accomplished
- `history` → Review your command history
- `man [command]` → Read manual entries
- `clear` (three times) → Triggers whisper about echoes/
- `grep -R fragment .` → Search for fragment mentions
- `grep -R ladder .` → Search for ladder references
- `grep -R echelon .` → Find all Echelon mentions

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
**Q: Assembly not completing?**
A: Make sure you're using `>>` (append) not `>` (overwrite) for lines 2 and 3.
   Check with `cat assembled_fragments.txt` to see what's actually in the file.

**Q: Unlock command not working?**
A: Ensure assembly is complete first (check with `progress`). The keyword is
   "echelon" (lowercase, no quotes needed).

**Q: Can't find fragments?**
A: Use `hint` command for location hints, or `grep -R fragment .` to search.

**Q: Puzzle answers not working?**
A: Puzzle 1: `ladder` (lowercase, no quotes)
   Puzzle 2: `signal maintains memory` (with quotes if spaces cause issues)

EASTER EGGS & OPTIONAL EXPLORATION
-----------------------------------
- `/echoes/whisper.log` → Revealed after clearing terminal 3 times
- `/echoes/ping.sequence` → Timeline of archive events
- `/secret/backdoor.log` → Sysop handshake phrases
- `/users/root/ghost_process.log` → Root override memos
- `/sites/reddit/mod_logs/` → Moderation tampering evidence
- `/users/alice/journal.txt` → Personal investigation notes
- `history` → Shows ghost_hint about erased history
- `man clear` → Documents the whisper mechanic

ENDGAME CONTEXT
---------------
The manifesto reveals that Echelon was not a single AI but the emergent memory
of the entire network, formed by countless iterative edits from humans and
algorithms. Your archivist proves the archive still remembers itself by
reconstructing the key phrase. The game ends not with a menu but with your
decision: keep, share, or ponder the truth you uncovered.

The unlock keyword "echelon" represents the project name that appears
throughout the archive - it's the simplest answer because it's been mentioned
repeatedly in your journey.

Happy excavating. Remember: the ladder is the habit of connecting clues. Keep climbing.
