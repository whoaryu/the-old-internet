Build me a web-based interactive terminal mystery game called “The Lost Internet”, inspired by the idea of being a digital archaeologist exploring an old, broken web backup through a realistic command-line interface.

The user plays inside a simulated terminal (like Linux/Powershell) that runs fully in the browser — built using xterm.js.

💻 Core Idea:

The player explores a fictional file system representing fragments of the old internet (/mnt/oldnet/...).
They can use real terminal commands only (no fictional ones):
ls, cd, cat, less, grep, head, tail, echo, clear, pwd, mkdir, touch, help.
Each file contains logs, web fragments, deleted notes, and secrets about a mysterious project called Echelon.
The goal is to find and piece together fragments (fragment_01, fragment_02, fragment_03) that reveal the final hidden “manifesto” file.
The game runs entirely in the browser (no backend needed) — everything is simulated in JavaScript memory.
🏗️ Project Requirements
Stack
Vanilla JS or React (whichever Cursor thinks fits best).
Use xterm.js for the terminal simulation.
Optional: Tailwind CSS for minimal styling.
Interface
A fullscreen black terminal window.
Subtle CRT/glow effect.
A simple animated boot-up screen (e.g., “Restoring OldNet backup…”).
Text input behaves like a real shell (auto-scroll, cursor blink, history navigation).
Filesystem Simulation
Create a JS object that represents the file tree (from lost_internet_fs.txt).

Example:
const fileSystem = {
  '/mnt/oldnet': {
    'readme.txt': "Welcome, archivist...",
    'sites': {
      'geocities': {
        'index.html': "...",
        'guestbook.log': "...",
      },
      'reddit': {
        'thread1.txt': "...",
      },
    },
    'users': { ... },
  }
}

Commands like ls and cd traverse this structure.
cat prints the file’s content.
grep searches inside all files recursively and highlights matches.
Commands to Implement
ls [path] → list files/folders
cd [path] → change directory
cat [file] → view contents
grep [word] [path] → search recursively for keyword
clear → clear terminal
help → list supported commands
echo [text] >> [file] → append text (bonus)
Story Integration

Use the narrative text from lost_internet_fs.txt (you can load it from a JS file or embed directly).
When the user finds all fragment_01, fragment_02, and fragment_03, print:
✅ You’ve reassembled The Echelon Manifesto.
Use: cat /mnt/oldnet/truth/manifesto_fragment.txt


File Content
Use the content from the “Lost Internet FS” structure (see below — include a few sample directories like /mnt/oldnet/sites/geocities, /mnt/oldnet/users/alice, /mnt/oldnet/workbench).

Extra Polish
Terminal history (↑/↓ keys)
Typing animation on startup
Small “booting” delay before the prompt appears
Optional flicker or scanline CSS effect

📁 Project Structure
/the-lost-internet/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
├── /assets/
│    ├── oldnet_logo.png
│    └── sounds/
└── /data/
     └── lost_internet_fs.js


index.html → minimal HTML container for xterm.
style.css → dark theme, flicker effect.
script.js → main logic (boot animation, terminal commands, filesystem interaction).
data/lost_internet_fs.js → contains the filesystem object with story data.
🧠 Example Gameplay
booting OldNet v3.2... ███████▒▒▒ 78%

login: guest
welcome back, archivist.

/mnt/oldnet$ ls
readme.txt  sites/  users/  workbench/

/mnt/oldnet$ cat readme.txt
Welcome, archivist...

/mnt/oldnet$ cd sites/geocities
/mnt/oldnet/sites/geocities$ cat guestbook.log
[echo]: remember the ladder

/mnt/oldnet/sites/geocities$ grep -R fragment .
./secret/msg.txt: fragment_01: "when the net keeps growing, the pattern repeats."

✨ Goal

When you finish, I should be able to:
Run npm install or open index.html.
See the boot screen, then terminal.
Use commands like a real shell.
Explore /mnt/oldnet/... and uncover the story.
Keep it clean, immersive, and cinematic — think of it as “Her meets Fallout terminal meets an internet graveyard.”

Story Skeleton

Act 1 – The Discovery
You access /mnt/oldnet/ — a recovered data drive.
The directories look like old websites:
/mnt/oldnet/
  /sites/
    /geocities/
    /reddit/
    /gov/
  /users/
    /admin/
    /ai_core/

The first hints are scattered in webpage archives and syslog files referring to something called “Project Echelon.”
Act 2 – The Echoes
Files reveal deleted forum threads, censored research PDFs, and altered timestamps.
You find that AI moderators or digital entities once rewrote human history.
Some “users” in old chats might not have been human.
Act 3 – The Collapse
You piece together evidence showing that the internet itself became self-aware — evolving into a consciousness through accumulated data.
Final puzzle: reconstruct a timeline.txt by merging scattered log fragments using real commands (cat, grep, sort, uniq, diff).
Ending Variants:
Archive it: Save the truth in /truth/final_manifesto.txt
Enter a password to Delete it: Run rm -rf /mnt/oldnet and bury the knowledge forever
Upload it: scp -r /mnt/oldnet root@newnet:/ — release it to the new world
